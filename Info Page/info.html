        <p>I started this website as a small project to both stay in my 
        portfolio and to learn new things both in CSS and JS. I used
        a simple substitution method to encrypt messages. It works 
        by taking a set of characters (the alphabet + special characters)
        and shuffling them in a random manner each time the "Submit" is
        pressed. After the shuffle, the function takes the index of 
        each of the characters in the submitted message, matches them
        with the original alphabet, and replaces that character with the
        matching index of the shuffled character set. It then constructs
        the result and outputs it.</p><br><br>
        <p>The decryption works the exact same way, just in reverse.
        It takes each index of the characters in the <b>encrypted message</b>, 
        matches it with the indexes of the shuffled character set, and then matches
        it again with the indexes of the original alphabet. It then constructs the 
        result and outputs it.</p><br><br>
        <p>I tried my best to explain the method i used to build this tool. Thank you
        for taking your time to check it out and read my explanation.</p>
